## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I was able to demonstrate the use of flexbox and grid layout while at the same time using media-query as shown below:
````
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {

    }
   
````

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn on layout using flexbox and grid and I will be focusing more responsive web design for future projects
