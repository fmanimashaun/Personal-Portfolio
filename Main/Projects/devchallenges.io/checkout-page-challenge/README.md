## Overview

![screenshot](final_screenshot.png)

This challenge was undertaken to further strengthen my understanding of basic HTML and CSS with consideration for a responsive design using algorithm layout concepts.

- The live demo can be seen [here](https://fmanimashaun.com/projects/devchallenges.io/checkout-page-challenge/)
- So far, I believe can say I am getting good with reading UI/UX design on Figma and implementing the design using HTML/CSS
- This particular challenge was a bit demanding and i decided to add a little extra by implementing a basic javascript DOM to manipulate some elements based on user interaction.
