This challenge was undertaken to further strengthen my understanding of basic HTML and CSS with consideration for a responsive design using algorithm layout concepts.

- The live demo can be seen [here](https://fmanimashaun.com/projects/devchallenges.io/interior-consultant-challenge/)
- So far, I believe can say I am getting good with reading UI/UX design on Figma and implementing the design using HTML/CSS/Javascript
- I feel there is still a lot to learn and understand with respect to the layout but there was a lot of improvement with this particular challenge with the use of custom modular scale and responsive design
