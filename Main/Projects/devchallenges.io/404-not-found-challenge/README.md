## Overview

![screenshot](final-solution.png)

This challenge was undertaken to further strengthen my understanding of basic HTML and CSS with consideration for responsive design.

- The live demo can be seen [here](https://github.com/fmanimashaun/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/Main/Projects/devchallenges.io/404-not-found-challenge)
- So far, I believe can say I am getting good with reading UI/UX design on Figma and implementing the design using HTML/CSS
- WI feel there is still a lot to learn and understand with respect to layout
